# sa                Simulated annealing algorithm
# hbmo              HoneyBee mating optimization algorithm
# hbmo-heft         Gets the number of available instances from HBMO algorithm and then do the Heterogeneous     Earliest Finish Time workflow scheduling algorithm
# heft-before-hbmo  At first, it runs the HEFT and gives the initial solution to the HBMO algorithm
#
# * Note that all of the algorithm's fitness are based on the HEFT algorithm
